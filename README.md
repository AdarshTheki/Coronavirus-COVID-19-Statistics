## Interpreting Your Results
**If Your COVID-19 Test is Positive:**

Any positive COVID-19 test means the virus was detected and you have an infection.

- Isolate and take precautions including wearing a high-quality mask to protect others from getting infected.
- Tell people you had recent contact with that they may have been exposed.
- Monitor your symptoms. If you have any emergency warning signs, seek emergency care immediately.
- Consider contacting a healthcare provider, community health center, or pharmacy to learn about treatment options that may be available to you. Treatment must be started within several days after you first develop symptoms to be effective.
  - You are more likely to get very sick if you are an older adult or have an underlying medical condition. Possible treatment may be available for you.

**HOW IT SPREADS?**

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.

You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.
